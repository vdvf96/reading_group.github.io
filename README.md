WELCOME EVERYONE!

This repo has been created for sharing recent and interesting papers (and ideas) with other people.
My research group, the (https://github.com/AIPOpt-Lab-SU/), has a weekly reading group, on Tuesday noon, 4 pm at 4-201, CST.

Our researches focus on optimization, the integration of optimization and machine learning, differential privacy, fairness, and much more!

We'd like other students and professors to partecipate! Feel free to join us :)

Here there is a list of the papers we plan to discuss:

Deep learning

- Minimizing Worst-Case Violations of Neural Networks, R. Nellikkath et. al. , https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10930.pdf

Predict and optimize

- Decision-Focused Learning without Decision-Making: Learning Locally Optimized Decision Losses, S. Shah et. al. , https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16067.pdf
- Comparison and Evaluation of Methods for a Predict+Optimize Problem in Renewable Energy, C. Bergmeir et. al. , https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10723.pdf
- Multi-Task Predict-then-Optimize, B. Tang et. al. , https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05403.pdf
